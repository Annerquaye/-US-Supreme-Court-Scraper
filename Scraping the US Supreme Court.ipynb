    "## Supreme Court Project Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of this project is to build a database of Supreme Court cases for 2020 (or a different range of years) that includes the dialogue from the oral arguments of each case. As we have seen in class the arguments were scraped from this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript.aspx \n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can follow that guide to downloading and transforming pdfs to texts (don't be shy on slack!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a folder of texts transcripts there are three primary programmatic steps that you need to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** Step 3 is the most challenging--if you want to spend some time coding, you can skip Steps 1 and 2 and get to work on Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 1:** scrape all of the case information available on this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2020\n",
    "\n",
    "This should include case name, docket number, etc--and most importantly the name of the PDF file. All of the text files share the exact same name as the PDF files they came from. This file name will allow you to connect your transcription data with your case data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is up to you what kind data structure you want to build. But it likely to be a list of lists, or list of dictionaries--for each case you will have a list or dictionary of the information you scrape from the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 2:** find secondary source(s) to scrape/integrate with your case data. The information on the Supreme Court page is very limited. You need to find a source or group of sources that ad information. The most important information would likely be: the decision, who voted for and against, and the district court origin of the case (for geocoding). You might think of other great things to put in there too! This information needs to be merged with the data you have from STEP 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 3:** use regular expressions to clean up and parse the text files so that you have a searchable data structure containing the dialog from the transcripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Architecture** \n",
    "You will need to think about how you will set up, separate, and join different tables that you create. The initial scraping will give you very simple dataframe: the columns will be dockett, case name, date argued, and PDF name. The regex work on the PDFs should result in a very simple table (or just a list of tuples) of speaker name and dialogue. \n",
    "\n",
    "`[('MR. BERGERON',\" Yes. That's essentially the same thing\"),('JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR',' So how do you deal with Chambers?')]`\n",
    "\n",
    "But make sure you attach the docket number or pdf filename to each set of arguments you transform using regex. Your secondary sources and information should be linked by docket number, but the question is how to set up those data frames, join them, aggregate them, and narrow them to the fields necessary for presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go step-by-step through this, and DM me on Slack whenever you get stuck, and I will help. If you complete all the steps before Friday, Slack me if you want to go further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretive Architecture**\n",
    "Also consider what kind of interpretive categories you can add through your reading and research. At the very least, it is recommended that you come up with categories for the kinds of cases that are before the court: human clustering for meaning is always more effective than computational clustering. Try to come up with perhaps 8 to 10 domains that groups of cases might belong to. But also think of other ways of categorizing these cases or these decisions--by politics, by consequences on citizens (you could make a scale from 1 to 10), even an aggregated index of consequences/effects on different types of communities, sectors, regions, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are the researcher, these categories or ways of expressing your point-of-view.\n",

       " {'title': 'Because it is unclear in this excessive force case whether the Eighth Circuit incorrectly thought the use of a prone restraint is per se constitutional so long as an individual appears to resist officers’ efforts to subdue him, the Eighth Circuit’s judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to give the court the opportunity in the first instance to employ the careful, context-specific analysis required by this Court’s excessive force precedent.'},\n",

This Court had not\\n\\n recognized a personal damages action under \\n\\nBivens for a violation of the Free Exercise \\n\\nClause, and it has not done so since.\\n\\n Moreover, prior to RFRA, Congress had \\n\\nenacted the Westfall Act, which adopted a broad \\n\\nbar to tort suits against federal employees to \\n\\nprevent the chilling effects for the executive \\n\\nbranch from the prospect of personal liability \\n\\nand protracted litigation for its employees. \\n\\nCongress has only very rarely departed from that \\n\\ngeneral rule and subjected federal employees to \\n\\npersonal damage suits.  When it has, it has done \\n\\nso expressly, which it did not do in RFRA. \\n\\nWhen Congress enacted RFRA to restore \\n\\nthe substantive standard for free exercise \\n\\nclaims to what it was prior to Smith, it did not \\n\\nat the same time significantly depart from the \\n\\nestablished remedial scheme. \\n\\nThis Court should not now read into \\n\\nthe text of RFRA, which provides only for relief \\n\\nagainst the government, a sweeping new  \\n\\n Bivens-style cause of action against federal \\n\\nemployees in their personal capacity for\\n\\n damages.\\n\\n \",\n",

Clark v. \\n\\nMartinez itself explains that sovereign immunity \\n\\nbarring relief in one circumstance does not \\n\\nremotely establish that a statute has two \\n\\nmeanings.  It just indicates that the single and  \\n\\n unchanging meaning of the statute does not apply\\n\\n against sovereigns.\\n\\n And Petitioners' concerns about\\n\\n damages potentially chilling executive function\\n\\n are identical to those raised in Hafer v. Melo. \\n\\nAnd what the Court held there is true here.\\n\\n Qualified immunity properly addresses those\\n\\n concerns.\\n\\n As for the separation of powers, Your \\n\\nHonor, that would only arise in this case if \\n\\nthis Court were to exclude damages where \\n\\nCongress provided them.  If, instead, this Court \\n\\nallows executive officials to be held to \\n\\nlegislative command, then that would be the \\n\\nseparation of powers at work fulfilling the \\n\\nconstitutional design. \\n\\nThe Court should affirm the decision \\n\\nbelow and remand for adjudication of the \\n\\nqualified immunity defense. \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\n\",\n",

       " 'MR. KNEEDLER',\n",
       " '  Thank you, Mr. Chief\\n\\n Justice.\\n\\n First, we think the text of the -- of\\n\\n RFRA\\'s remedies provision answers this question \\n\\nby providing for appropriate relief against the\\n\\n government.  And money damages are not \\n\\nappropriate relief against the government, at \\n\\nleast in the absence of something expressly so \\n\\nproviding.  And we don\\'t have it here. \\n\\nJustice Gorsuch raised the question of \\n\\nwhether the phrase \"appropriate relief\" refers \\n\\nto the general law of remedies.  That\\'s -- the \\n\\n-- the Court in Franklin invoked that when the \\n\\nCourt was completely free to -- to devise \\n\\nremedies for a cause of action that it had \\n\\nitself created. \\n\\nIn this context, the law of remedies, \\n\\nthough, includes important other limitations, \\n\\nincluding the sovereign immunity of the \\n\\nsovereign, which is what renders money damages \\n\\nnot appropriate relief against the government, \\n\\nand individual government officials are included \\n\\nonly insofar as they are part of the government  \\n\\n under RFRA\\'s definition.\\n\\n In addition, as Justice Kagan pointed\\n\\n out, there -- there are reasons beyond that to\\n\\n expect Congress to be especially clear if it was \\n\\nsubjecting federal employees to personal money \\n\\ndamages under a statute, after all, that applies \\n\\nthroughout the government, anytime there is a \\n\\nstatute of general applicability, for example, \\n\\nthat an employee is charged with administering. \\n\\nAnd, in fact, we know that Congress \\n\\nrarely provides or allows private damages \\n\\nactions against the federal government.  That\\'s \\n\\nthe background principle of -- of the -- the \\n\\nWestfall Act.  And when Congress has allowed \\n\\npersonal damage actions, it has done so \\n\\nexpressly.  And we have nothing express here. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s further supported by, I \\n\\nthink, the point that Justice Kavanaugh was \\n\\nmaking, which is that there\\'s an odd fit here \\n\\nbeyond the general concern about chilling \\n\\ngovernment employees, especially in this \\n\\nnational security context, that RFRA is directed \\n\\nat statutes and rules of general applicability, \\n\\nand yet -- and is designed to allow exemptions \\n\\nfrom that.  \\n\\nBut this is putting a government \\n\\nemployee in the position, perhaps on the spot,\\n\\n of deciding whether to create an exemption to a\\n\\n particular governmental interest.  And beyond \\n\\nthat, RFRA itself provides that it\\'s the \\n\\ngovernment that must provide or furnish --\\n\\nestablish that there\\'s a compelling interest, \\n\\nand these are the least restrictive means for\\n\\n doing it. \\n\\nAnd often the individual government \\n\\nemployee wouldn\\'t have access even to the \\n\\ninformation necessary to -- to make that defense \\n\\nand would need to -- discovery against --\\n\\nagainst the government. \\n\\nSo even looking at what the \\n\\nappropriate remedies are, they aren\\'t available. \\n\\nAnd RFRA contains nothing like the action at law \\n\\nunder 1983, which is what gives rise to damages \\n\\nthere, to the extent RFRA was patterned after \\n\\n1983. \\n\\n',\n",

Look for words or phrases that uniquely repeat at the beginning and at the end of the arguments. The easiest way to isolate this, to do a simple split() on one of those phrases, and keep the half of The split you want.
